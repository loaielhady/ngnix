💻 Installing Git on Windows
The simplest and most common way to install Git on Windows is by using the official installer.

Steps:
Download the Installer: Go to the official Git website and download the latest installer for Windows.

Run the Installer: Double-click the downloaded .exe file to start the installation.

Follow Prompts: You can generally accept the default settings during the installation, as they are configured for the most common use cases.

Key choice: When prompted about adjusting your PATH environment, ensure you select the option that allows you to use Git from the Command Prompt (usually "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software").

Complete Installation: Finish the process and click "Finish."

Verification: Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following command to verify the installation:

```html
 <p> git --version </p>
```

If successful, it will display the installed Git version.
